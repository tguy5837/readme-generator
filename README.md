# README.md Generator!

## Description

This is a README.md generator that runs through NodeJS. This application will produce for the user, a formatted README.md file which includes information based on user input. When the user runs the application, they will be presented with a series of prompts which will require user input, user confirmation, and user selections.

This project was created to streamline the process of creating your README. In fact, this README you are currently reading was generated by this program!

The project was built using node through VS Code.

## Installation

To run this application, first make sure that you have installed NodeJS and then clone the README Generator repository to your local computer and make sure to install all of the required packages and dependencies by running 'npm i' in the root directory of the cloned repository.

## Usage

Confirm that you are in the root directory of your repository and run the command 'node index.js'. This will run the application and begin to prompt the user for questions. If you plan to add a picture to the usage section, please have the file path ready to go when you begin running the README generator.
